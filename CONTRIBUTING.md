## "I Have a Question!"

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/retched/ZC-USPSRestful/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/retched/ZC-USPSRestful/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
- What is the environment that the script is running from? (What version of PHP? What version of the script? What version of ZenCart?)

The more details available, makes the problem easier to track down and start issuing bugfixes for.

I will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

Additionally, you can use Discord (@retched) in addition to reach out.

## Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. All submissions should be presented through the "Github Flow" (as discussed below). If you don't want to go through the hassle of making a Github account, you can submit suggestions through the [ZenCart Support Thread](https://www.zen-cart.com/showthread.php?230512-USPS-Shipping-(RESTful)-(USPSr)) for the module.

## [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) is the preferred process of suggesting changes

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main` (do not use the versioned branches ).
2. Make sure your code lints.
3. Issue that pull request!

## Coding Style

If you're submitting a pull request, PLEASE try to adhere to the PSR-12 standard. Similar to that of the main [Zen Cart Coding Standards](https://docs.zen-cart.com/dev/contributing/coding_standards/).

In summary your submitted code should be (at a minimum):

- Using four spaces for indentation rather than tabs.
- Functions' opening brace should be on the next line after the declaration. See below for an example:

  ``` php
  function uspsr_someFunctionName($variables_if_needed = '', $some_boolean = TRUE)
  {
    // Code here
  }
  ```

- When inserting comments, try to use the PHPDocumentor coding standard (also known as the [PHP DocBlock](https://docs.phpdoc.org/guide/getting-started/what-is-a-docblock.html) syntax). Otherwise be as descriptive as you feel you need to be.
