As the first line reads, DO NOT COPY ALL THE FILES INTO YOUR ZENCART!!

This zip file contains BOTH the encapsulated (for ZenCart 2.1.0 and 2.0.x) and non-encapsulated (all ZenCart from 1.5.6 and upward) in the same install.

**DO NOT UPLOAD ALL THE FILES in the main directory to your ZenCart.**

Copy only the folders needed to your ZenCart. As outlined below.

- If you are using ZenCart versions: 1.5.5, 1.5.6, 1.5.7, 1.5.8, 2.x and you do NOT want to use the module manager:

  - Copy the contents of `/admin` into YOUR admin directory. (_You did rename it, right?_)
  - Copy the contents of `/includes` to your catalog's includes folder  
  The one in your ZenCart's root. The contents and folders of /includes should end up INSIDE of /includes. You may get a warning about overwriting a .gif file, that's fine.

- If you are using ZenCart 2.1.0, 2.2.0, or newer and you want to use the module manager:

  - Copy ONLY the zc\_plugins directory to the root of your ZenCart directory  
  Make sure that directory has the subdirectory USPSRestful.

===

AGAIN, let me repeat...

# DO NOT COPY BOTH admin, includes, AND zc\_plugins. THIS WILL CAUSE conflicts and is timely to repair!

If you need help, send a reply to the [ZenCart USPS Restful MegaThread](https://www.zen-cart.com/showthread.php/230512-USPS-Shipping-(RESTful)-(USPSr)) or DM retched in the forums. If you're trying to report an error, please either provide the log generated by USPSr and ZenCart, or in FULL DETAIL, explain what the steps one would need to replicate what you did.
